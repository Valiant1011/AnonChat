# AnonChat
Anonymous Social Networking system

# Readme  
## How to run:
1. Run Server/Server.py
2. Run Client/Client.py  
3. Register as a new user on the client, and you will be logged in.  
* The system is limited to run only one client per computer, so you'll need some friends on your network.  
* Obviously this is a development version. When the system goes live, you will only need to run the Client executable.  
# !!!REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD!!!
* The perks of being anonymous include a downside: I do not have any means of resetting your passwords. So yeah, remember them or make a new account. You will only lose a few imaginary internet points.
